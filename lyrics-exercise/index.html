        Movement - Hozier
    </h1>
    <div class="lyrics">
        I still watch you when you're groovin' <br>
        As if through water from the bottom of a pool <br>
        You're movin' without movin' <br>
        And when you move, I'm moved <br>
        You are a call to motion <br>
        There, all of you a verb in perfect view <br>
        Like Jonah on the ocean <br>
        When you move, I'm moved <br><br>
        When you move <br>
        I'm put to mind of all that I wanna be <br>
        When you move <br>
        I could never define all that you are to me <br><br>
        So move me, baby <br>
        Shake like the bough of a willow tree <br>
        You do it naturally <br>
        Move me, baby <br><br>
        You are the rite of movement <br>
        Its reasonin' made lucid and cool <br>
        I know it's no improvement <br>
        When you move, I move <br>
        You're less Polunin leapin' <br>
        Or Fred Astaire in sequins <br>
        Honey, you, you're Atlas in his sleepin' <br>
        And when you move, I'm moved <br><br>
        When you move <br>
        I can recall somethin' that's gone from me <br>
        When you move <br>
        Honey, I'm put in awe of somethin' so flawed and free <br><br>
        So move me, baby <br>
        Shake like the bough of a willow tree <br>
        You do it naturally <br>
        Move me, baby <br>
        So move me, baby <br>
        Like you've nothin' left to prove <br>
        And nothin' to lose <br>
        Move me, baby <br><br>
        Ooh, ooh, ooh <br>
        Oh baby, oh baby <br>
        Move like grey skies <br>
        Move like a bird of paradise <br>
        Move like an odd sight come out at night <br><br>
        Move me, baby <br>
        Shake like the bough of a willow tree <br>
        You do it naturally <br>
        Move me, baby <br>
        So move me, baby <br>
        Like you've nothin' left to lose <br>
        And nothin' to prove <br>
        Move me, baby <br>
        So move me, baby <br>
        Shake like the bough of a willow tree <br>
        You do it naturally <br>
        Move me, baby
