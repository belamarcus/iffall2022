                <li>Bela Marcus, Communication Design & American Culture Studies, Junior</li>
                <li>I took computer sciences classes in high school and volunteered with Girls Who Code. I haven't really touched coding since high school, so I am excited to try programming again. Also, the class is required for my major.</li>
                <li>I worked a bit with JS in high school, but do not remember much of it.</li>
                <li>I hope to learn more about the tech side of design and get more comfortable with digital design. I don't know much about UI design to begin with, so I am excited to see if it's something I enjoy and want to continue.</li>
                <li>I think I have a relatively strong mental relationship between my hand and my mind. I'm curious about the relationship between programming and imagination when visualizing code.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.target.com/">https://www.target.com/</a>In their website, Target manages to accomplish the same thing they do in their store which is put items in my cart that I did not initially go there to buy. I believe they do this through eye-catching images of their products and giving related recommendations even when you are looking at one product.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/">https://www.dndbeyond.com/</a>As a reference for DnD, the website has a very clear hierarchy to navigate to the information you need. They go into great detail but you have to navigate to access it, so you are not presented with a ton of overwhelming information right off the bat but still can easily get to specifics.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/">https://www.poetryfoundation.org/</a>The poetry foundation always has the poem I'm looking for. It is simple. And it works. And the colors are nice. And all the poems have the same fonts for title and body. And I'm never angry when I'm on that website.</li>
